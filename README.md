This is an app for the rooted (Dutch) Toon for controlling a WPB (WaterPump Boiler). 

Normally you can program the WPB when to heat the water in the boiler when it is below a specific temperature. I have a WPB Atlantic Explorer V4 which also has a PV contact. That means you can switch on the boiler when activating the contact, regardless of the running program. It intended use is to switch on the WPB when there is enough power from your solar panels.

With this app you can control automatically or manual the PV contact of the WPB. It needs some additional hardware.
